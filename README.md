# Project-PBL
A repository dedicated to a project for Automatic salary calculation system.
Problem Description:
Payroll processing is a crucial task in every organization, requiring precision in salary calculations, tax deductions, and record maintenance. Manual payroll management is time-consuming and prone to errors, leading to discrepancies in employee payments. To overcome these challenges, an automated Employee Salary Slip Generation Tool is proposed. This C-based program calculates net salaries by incorporating allowances and deductions, ensuring accuracy in payroll processing. Additionally, it enables businesses to securely store and retrieve structured payment records using file handling.
